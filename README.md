# OverRide-Server
This is the server &amp; package repo of a OverRapid mod that I made a while back. Open to all since the dev abandoned the game and is no longer adding new content.

## The Server

Simply get the code, download the asset, place the asset, edit `config.py`'s host and port, and run.

## The Client

Simply download the client, install/sideload, and run. Follow the UI to enter the `http(s)://HOST:PORT/`, and click continue.

Note. The package released carries the same security level as the official packages, from the official stores. Don't snoop around, but certainly have fun!
